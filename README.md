# Farlander

This is a Minecraft Spigot Plugin with two purposes:
1. Bring back the farlands to the game.
2. Help me understand how the game's terrain generator works (and more importantly, how to break it).

## Planned features:
- Be able to set coordinates from where onwards the farlands are generated, for each world.
- Be able te set parameters for the farland generation.
- Be able to set coordinates from where onwards the fartherlands are generated, for each world.
- More specific farland regions instead of from here onwards (?

## Resources I used:
Thanks to everybody that made them.
